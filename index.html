    <p> Bibliography   The bibliography is located at the end of the main body of your work, after the reference list.
    It lists the full details of items which you have read, but to which you have NOT referred directly in your text.
    There is, therefore, no citation in your text for an item listed in your bibliography.
    Such items would include background reading.
    The list is arranged alphabetically by author.
    It may be possible to combine your reference list and bibliography, but you should check with your school before doing so. </p>
